## [1.1.0] - 2026-07-23

### Added
- YAML config file support (`-config` flag > `$CTXMODE_CONFIG` env > `./ctxmode-config.yaml` > `~/.config/ctxmode/config.yaml`)
- Multi-workdir support: paths under any directory in the `workdirs:` list are accepted as valid cwd
- `resolvePath` validates path containment against all configured workdirs
- `toolSearch` result paths are correctly relativized against the first matching workdir
- `excludeFromGit` runs `.git/info/exclude` exclusion for each workdir
- Falls back to cwd when no config is present (backward compatible)
